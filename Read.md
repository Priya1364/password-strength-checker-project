🔐 Basic Password Strength Checker Using Python
📍 Project Overview
This project is a simple Python program that evaluates the strength of a user-provided password.
It classifies passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong based on five conditions such as length, digits, uppercase/lowercase letters, and special characters.
🎯 Objective
To design a basic password strength checker using Python and practice key programming concepts such as:
Variables and Data Types
Operators
User Input
Conditional Statements
Loops
Functions

🧠 Features
✅ Checks if the password:
Has at least 8 characters
Contains at least one digit
Contains at least one lowercase letter
Contains at least one uppercase letter
Contains at least one special character

✅ Classifies the password as:
Weak → if it meets 0–2 conditions
Medium → if it meets 3–4 conditions
Strong → if it meets all 5 conditions

🧩 Technologies Used
Python 3 (Tested on Pydroid 3 Android App)
Basic Python Libraries (No external modules required)🧾 Sample Output
Copy code

----- Basic Password Strength Checker -----
Enter your password: Hello@123
Password Strength: Strong

Enter your password: hello123
Password Strength: Medium

Enter your password: abc
Password Strength: Weak
